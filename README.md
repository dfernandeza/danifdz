My personal site/blog. Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) :heart:

## :rocket: Quick start

1.  Install all dependencies

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1.  Start development mode. Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
