I am not by any means a functional programming expert and honestly I'm not aspiring to become one however, the more I learn about it the more I realize its benefits specially when applied to JavaScript. This is why I want to keep improving my understanding of it and I'd like to share my learning experience by writing a series of articles where I will explain my approach to learn functional programming.

First, I will try to build a solid knowledge base by tackling the concepts that in my humble opinion are fundamental to properly learn functional programming.

> In my personal experience, I've found that many other resources out there take these concepts for granted which makes the learning process harder.

Then, I'll progressively introduce more concepts until we have enough information to structure our own mental model.

I'm describing this as a functional approach because I'll follow the single responsibility principle, (don't worry we will get to that concept) each article in these series will explain one single concept and I'll do my best to keep them short and concise.

1. [Function's anatomy](/functions)
2. [Functions as values](/functions-as-values)
3. [Function composition, first steps](/function-composition-first-steps)
4. [Specialized functions](/specialized-functions)
5. [Closures](/closures)
6. [Mapping](/mapping)
7. [Filtering](/filtering)
8. Reducing (coming soon)
